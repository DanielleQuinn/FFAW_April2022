## Data and R Training  
### 26 - 28 April 2022  

**Fish, Food, and Allied Workers**  
*St John's, Newfoundland*  
*Instructor: Danielle Quinn*

#### 1. Install R  

If you are using Windows, use [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) to download and install the software.  

If you are using a Mac, go to [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), and select the link associated with the location nearest to you. From there, follow the link to the Mac download and select the most up-to-date version to access the files you will need to download and install the software.  

*If you already have R installed on your computer, please ensure that it is at least version 4.0*

#### 2. Install RStudio  

Install the free RStudio IDE from [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) by selecting the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows or Mac).  

*If you already have RStudio installed on your computer, please ensure that it is at least version 1.4*

**Note: If you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later.**

#### 3. Install Packages  

Install the up-to-date versions of the required packages, using the following code:  

`install.packages(dplyr)`  
`install.packages(tidyr)`  
`install.packages(lubridate)`  
`install.packages(ggplot2)`  
`install.packages(stringr)`    

*If you are not familiar with running code in RStudio or are not able to install the packages, don't worry! We will cover this during the workshop, but it will save you some time if you can do this before then.*


#### 4. Download the workshop materials

Click on the green button labelled "Code" near the top of the screen. Select "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, unzip these files and save them to a **new folder** on your computer that is easy to find.  

### Office Hours
